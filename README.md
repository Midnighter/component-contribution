Description of files in /data:
------------------------------
* compounds.tsv - table of all KEGG compounds, their name and InChI (used only in Matlab code)
* fixed_mapping.tsv - table mapping some KEGG compound IDs to BiGG IDs (overriding the InChI-based mapping)
* formation_energies_transformed.tsv - table of biochemical formation energies (used for training CC)
* kegg_additions.tsv - table of compounds that are missing from KEGG together with their InChI
* kegg_compounds.json.gz - JSON of all KEGG compounds including their InChI and names
* redox.tsv - table of reduction potentials (used for training CC)
* TECRDB.tsv - table of K'eq values from the NIST database (http://xpdb.nist.gov/enzyme_thermodynamics/)
