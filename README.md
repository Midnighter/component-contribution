======================

Standard reaction Gibbs energy estimation for biochemical reactions

Requirements:
* Python 2.7
* Numpy 1.6.2+

Not strictly required:
* Matlab 7+
* (or instead of Matlab) Octave 3.6.4 and oct2py 1.3.0
* Open-Babel 2.3.1+ ('babel' must be in PATH, including python bindings)
* ChemAxon's Marvin 5.11+ ('cxcalc' must be in PATH)

Description of files in /data:
------------------------------
* compounds.tsv - table of all KEGG compounds, their name and InChI (used only in Matlab code)
* fixed_mapping.tsv - table mapping some KEGG compound IDs to BiGG IDs (overriding the InChI-based mapping)
* formation_energies_transformed.tsv - table of biochemical formation energies (used for training CC)
* kegg_additions.tsv - table of compounds that are missing from KEGG together with their InChI
* kegg_compounds.json.gz - JSON of all KEGG compounds including their InChI and names
* redox.tsv - table of reduction potentials (used for training CC)
* TECRDB.tsv - table of K'eq values from the NIST database (http://xpdb.nist.gov/enzyme_thermodynamics/)
